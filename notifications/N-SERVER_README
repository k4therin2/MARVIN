basically you gotta run the N-SERVER here at all times.
Theres prolly gonna b 5 different N-SERVERs for each port for different pi connnections
Each one will read from a different topic (e.g. a topic for its respected device.  If dave gets a
	message, publish to dave)

Each pi, on startup, will start it's own script which initiates a connection with the server,
then just listens for ANY message, which will then cause it to play the message notification



If we want, we can publish the sender's name to the topic, send that to the pi, and use
a different TTS engine to say you have a message from -Sender-, otherwise the notification
will need to be general

NAMES OF PI's AND PORTS:

Austin: 81
Rose: 82
Arthur: 83
Douglas: 84
Adam: 85
